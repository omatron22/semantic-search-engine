  COFFEE — VISION
==========================================

------------------------------------------
  WHAT IT IS
------------------------------------------

  A web application that lets companies search across ALL their
  information — local files, emails, cloud storage, chat history —
  using natural language, with everything stored on the server.

  No data leaves the machine. No cloud APIs for search. No SaaS fees.
  The AI model runs locally via SentenceTransformer embeddings.

------------------------------------------
  CORE VALUE PROPOSITION
------------------------------------------

  1. UNIFIED SEARCH
     One search bar across files, emails, and future data sources.
     "Find the budget email from January" works whether it's a
     PDF on disk or an email in Gmail.

  2. PRIVACY-FIRST
     All data stays local. Embeddings are generated on-device.
     No content is sent to external APIs. Companies with
     sensitive data (legal, medical, financial) can adopt this
     without compliance concerns.

  3. ZERO ONGOING COST
     No per-seat SaaS fees. No API usage charges. Once deployed,
     it runs forever on local hardware.

  4. PLUGGABLE CONNECTORS
     Gmail today. Outlook, Google Drive, Slack, Notion tomorrow.
     The connector framework makes adding new sources straightforward:
     download data → save as .txt → existing pipeline indexes it.

------------------------------------------
  TARGET CUSTOMERS
------------------------------------------

  - Small/mid companies (10-200 people) drowning in scattered info
  - Legal firms that can't use cloud search (confidentiality)
  - Healthcare orgs with HIPAA constraints
  - Engineering teams wanting to search code + docs + emails together
  - Anyone frustrated with enterprise search tools that don't work

------------------------------------------
  ARCHITECTURE ADVANTAGE
------------------------------------------

  The key insight: connectors are just downloaders.

  They pull data from external sources and save it as local .txt
  files. The existing indexing pipeline (chunking → embedding →
  LanceDB vector store) processes them unchanged.

  This means:
  - Adding a new connector doesn't touch the search engine
  - Search quality improvements benefit ALL data sources
  - The system stays simple and testable

------------------------------------------
  ROADMAP
------------------------------------------

  PHASE 1 (Current): Local files + Gmail connector
  - Folder indexing with 15+ file type support
  - Gmail/IMAP email sync with incremental updates
  - Background sync engine with scheduling
  - Hybrid search (vector + BM25 + reranking)

  PHASE 2: More connectors
  - Google Drive / OneDrive (download docs locally)
  - Outlook (IMAP or EWS)
  - Slack (export channel history)

  PHASE 3: Team features
  - Multi-user support (shared indexes, personal connectors)
  - Admin dashboard for managing company connectors
  - SSO integration

  PHASE 4: Intelligence
  - Auto-summarization of search results
  - "Related documents" suggestions
  - Smart alerts ("notify me when something about X arrives")

------------------------------------------
  COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE
------------------------------------------

  Glean, Coveo, Elastic Workplace Search — all cloud-based,
  expensive ($10-30/user/month), require sending data to their
  servers.

  This project offers the same capability with:
  - $0 ongoing cost
  - Complete data privacy
  - Desktop-native performance
  - No vendor lock-in

------------------------------------------
  TECHNICAL STACK
------------------------------------------

  Frontend: React SPA (Vite + Express)
  Backend:  FastAPI (Python) + Express (Node.js)
  Search:   SentenceTransformer embeddings + LanceDB vector DB
  Optional: Ollama for local LLM query expansion
  New:      Connector framework + sync engine (stdlib IMAP)
